## Reasoning
Krita, unlike other art programs, does not provide an eraser tool. Rather, erasing is a blending mode toggle that allows you to paint with transparent pixels. This is great if you're painting, but not so great if you're drawing, especially if you're drawing with a thin brush. The typical workaround is to leverage the Ten Brushes plugin which comes installed with Krita, but the problem here is that transparent erasing and brush-preset erasing now must be bound to separate hotkeys. This is a normal paradigm in other programs, as most drawing software provides a way to paint with transparent pixels that exists separate from an eraser tool, so for most it's not an issue. Most probably won't even need or want to use both. For me, however, I wanted a way, utilizing the same shortcut key, to switch between those two types of erasing depending on the brush I'm using. That's the purpose behind this plugin.
