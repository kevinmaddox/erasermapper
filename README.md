# EraserMapper
Krita plugin that allows you to create brush mappings via the eraser shortcut.

## Reasoning
Krita, unlike other art programs, does not provide an eraser tool. Rather, erasing is a blending mode toggle that effectively allows you to paint with transparent pixels. This is great if you're painting, but not so great if you're drawing, especially if you're drawing with a thin brush. The typical workaround is to leverage the Ten Brushes plugin which comes installed with Krita, but the problem here is that transparent erasing and brush-preset erasing now must be bound to separate hotkeys. This is a normal paradigm in other programs, as most drawing software provides a way to paint with transparent pixels that exists separate from an eraser tool, so for most it's not an issue. For me, however, I wanted a way to switch between those two types of erasing depending on the brush I'm using with the same shortcut. That's the purpose behind this plugin.
